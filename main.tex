\section*{Introduction}
this part should say our motivation for the device 

The goal of SmartBell is to create a device that accurately tracks and measures metrics of physical activity with use of a dumbbell.

\subsection{Overview of Device}
this can outline its specific capabilities

Physical design:
tbd for some of it buttt 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small (<1$exp(2)$ inch area) sticker-like object 
\end{itemize}

Hardware elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accelerometer: accurately measures the acceleration of the device. The data from the accelerometer will be analyzed to determine what type of movement was performed, how long it took to perform the movement, the distance which the dumbell traveled, etc. 
    \item 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Timeline}
this will be rough dates by which we wanna finish things
